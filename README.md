# Prenup_Ethereum
This is the first ever prenup on Ethereum blockchain (to the best of my knowledge). You can take this code to write your own prenup too! 
I and my fiance, Sayalee Kaluskar are getting married on 10th December 2016, and thought that this was a funny way to prove a point! Since I am working on my startup, Attores, and she is working as an Art Director at Ogilvy, Singapore, we thought to put our talents to use.

The architecture of this is simple. I have put a document on IPFS which serves as a templates and has all the covenants of our prenup agreement. Then I have put all the variables from that document in a Smart Contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
In the smart contract, both I and my fiance need to "accept" the terms and conditions by calling the method "accept" from our own personal addresses, which are again stored in the smart contract.

Address of the Smart Contract - 0x5657b8d985be88af0f3d2dc064e2db784071ae1c 
IPFS Hash of the document - 
Document (same as IPFS) on Google Drive -
